                        I brainstored three different people
                        with different situations who would want 
                        to use this app.

                    I created different scenarios with all of the personas 
                    that involve the use of the app Fashion Choice.

                        I decided to show a basic vesion of the features
                        in this app a basic way of how they work.

                        This diagram shows the thoughts going into creating the 
                        perfect version of this app that makes it useful and 
                        easy for users to use.

                    This prototype shows what happens when you first enter 
                    the app Fashion Choice and the different options within 
                    the app. I go into and show how the different options work
                    and how to exit as well.
